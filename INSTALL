cmake is used as the build system. Note that after creating or
deleting source files, you will need to re-run cmake to update the list of
files to compile.

*** Building ***

To compile on Linux:
	mkdir -p build
	cd build
	cmake ..
	make
Executable name is powder

To cross compile for Windows using MinGW on Linux:
	mkdir -p build
	cd build
	cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmake/toolchain-cross-mingw-linux.cmake
	make
Executable name is powder.exe


If compiling on Windows using MinGW or MSYS, you may need to change 
the cmake generator type. Run cmake --help for a list of available 
generator types

For example:
	cmake .. -G "MSYS Makefiles"


So far, compiling with cmake has only been tested on Linux (both 
native compiling and cross compiling for Windows), and MinGW+MSYS 
running in Wine. 


*** Build options ***

To turn debug symbols on or off, set CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE

Available options include:

CMake option name              Default
-----------------------------------------
GravityFFT                       ON
LuaConsole                       ON
PreferStatic                     OFF
NoWarnings                       OFF
Optimisations                    ON
CheckPartsAlloc                  OFF
CheckBounds                      OFF
Tests                            maybe (tri-state)
simdpp                           maybe (tri-state)
TargetArch                       native

To change an option, add -DOptionName=value to the end of the cmake 
command. For example, disable optimisations by adding 
-DOptimisations=OFF

To see help for each option, and the current option values, run cmake -LH

The "maybe" value for Tests means "only if the relevant library is already
installed".

GravityFFT and LuaConsole are optional, and Powder Toy will function 
fine if they are disabled. However, enabling them is recommended, since 
GravityFFT allows part of the game (the Newtonian gravity 
calculations) to run a lot faster, and LuaConsole adds useful extra 
functionality.

GravityFFT requires the single precision version of the FFTW3 library 
(fftw3f), and LuaConsole requires Lua 5.1.

libsimdpp can optionally be used to make some functions faster, by using SIMD
instructions. 

If you get error messages mentioning "-march=native", try setting TargetArch
to "none". If compiling binaries to distribute to other people, you should
set TargetArch to something else, such as x86 or x86-legacy, to ensure that
they work on a wide variety of computers instead of just yours.

Most libraries are linked statically where available, to avoid having 
to mess around with DLLs for Windows, and to try to avoid issues due to 
differences in libbz2 naming conventions between Linux distros. Change 
this with -DPreferStatic=OFF
